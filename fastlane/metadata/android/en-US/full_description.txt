ownCloud is a free software package you can install on a server to manage files,
contacts, calendars, music, pictures and much more. This is the official Android
app which enables you to browse all of your ownCloud synced files, create and
edit new files, share these files and folders with co-workers, and keep the
contents of those folders in sync across all of your devices. Simply copy a file
into a directory on your server and ownCloud does the rest.
